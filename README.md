Fraud Detection Modelling with Classification and Anomaly Detection Algorithm

Fraud detection is a field commonly pursued in multiple domains such as banking, financial instutions, and transactions related activities. 
This project explores 4 different Classification models to build model effective in fraud detection; including LR, DT, RF, and XGBoost.

To depict a real-life scenario, anomaly detection approach is also used to simulate situation where the Ground Truth is not present for use by the Data Team to analyze.
Utilizing Isolation Forest, it is observed that an anomaly detection model is effective in detecting fraudulent activities without the presence of Ground Truth for training data, although with a significantly lower performance.
